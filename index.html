    <h2>Amazing Roommates</h2>
    <p1>I have 2 fantastic roommates that where chosen randomly. My roommates and I have been living together for a long time now and I can honestly say that I have grown to love them like family. We have shared so many memories over the years, from late night talks to silly pranks, and I know that I can always count on them for support and companionship. They are always there to listen and offer advice, even when things get tough. They have become some of my closest friends, and I am so grateful to have them in my life.We've been stuck together since 2015. We each have July birthdays.</p1>
